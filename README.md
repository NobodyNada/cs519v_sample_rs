# CS 559 Rust Sample

This is a version of the sample code for Dr. Mike Bailey's [CS 559](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs519v) course, rewritten in Rust using the [vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) API bindings.

To run this on Mac, install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) first. Be sure to either select the option for "System Global Installation", or [set some environment variables](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash#macos) so the program knows where to locate the Vulkan libraries.

As long as you have Rust installed, you can compile and run this by running `cargo run`.
